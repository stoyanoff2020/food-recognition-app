   ```

3. **Build release APK** (for production)
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

4. **Find your APK**
   - Debug APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
   - Release APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

5. **Install on your phone**
   - Transfer APK to your phone via USB, email, or cloud storage
   - Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android Settings > Security
   - Tap the APK file to install

### Method 2: Use GitHub Actions (No local setup required)

1. **Push code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add build workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

   - Go back to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Connect phone to computer**
   ```bash
   # Check if device is connected

   ```

3. **Install directly**
   ```bash
   # Install debug version directly to phone
   flutter install
   
   # Or run the app directly
   flutter run
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No Android SDK found"**
   - Install Android Studio
   - Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
   - Run `flutter doctor` to verify setup

2. **"Install from unknown sources" disabled**
   - Go to Android Settings > Security
   - Enable "Unknown sources" or "Install unknown apps"
   - For newer Android versions, enable per-app when prompted

3. **App crashes on startup**
   - Check if your phone has Android 5.0+ (API level 21)
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - Check internet connection for API calls

4. **Build errors**
   - Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
   - Update Flutter: `flutter upgrade`
   - Check `flutter doctor` for issues

### Performance Tips

- **For better performance**: Use release APK instead of debug
- **For smaller file size**: Use `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`
- **For testing**: Debug APK includes debugging tools

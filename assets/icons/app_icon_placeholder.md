# App Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the app icon. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG image for the app icon
2. Name it `app_icon.png` and place it in `assets/icons/`
3. The icon should represent food recognition/camera functionality
4. Use the app's brand colors and be recognizable at small sizes

Recommended design elements:
- Camera lens or viewfinder
- Food items (fruits, vegetables)
- Clean, modern design
- High contrast for visibility
- Brand colors from the app theme

The flutter_launcher_icons package will automatically generate all required sizes for different platforms.

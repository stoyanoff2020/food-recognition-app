# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Food Recognition App is a hybrid mobile application that leverages computer vision and AI to identify food items from photos and provide recipe suggestions. Users can capture images of food, receive ingredient identification, discover recipes based on detected ingredients, and customize recipes by adding additional ingredients. The hybrid framework approach ensures easy maintenance across multiple platforms while providing a native-like user experience.
